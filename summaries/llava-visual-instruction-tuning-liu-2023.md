# Visual Instruction Tuning (LLaVA) (Liu et al., 2023)

## TL;DR
- Connects a pretrained image encoder to a pretrained LLM and instruction-tunes on image–text conversations.
- Produces strong open-source multimodal chat capabilities with relatively simple alignment data.
- Uses a projection layer to map visual features into the LLM’s token space, enabling end-to-end generation.
- Demonstrates that instruction-following generalizes to multimodal settings.
- Inspires a wave of open multimodal assistants.

## 1) Title and Citation
- Visual Instruction Tuning (LLaVA). Liu, H. et al. 2023. arXiv:2304.08485.

## 2) Problem and Motivation
Open-source multimodal assistants lagged behind proprietary systems. LLaVA shows that coupling a vision encoder with an LLM and instruction-tuning on curated image–text dialogs yields capable multimodal chat, lowering the barrier to experimentation and deployment.

## 3) Core Idea and Contributions
- Architecture: vision encoder → projection → LLM; generate responses conditioned on both image features and text.
- Instruction-tuning: train on synthetic/curated conversations to align behavior to user instructions and visual grounding.
- Open-source: practical recipe reproducible by the community.

Pointers:
- Method: projection design and instruction-tuning datasets.
- Results: competitive performance on multimodal chat tasks and VQA-like evaluations.

## 4) Method (Plain-Language)
- Extract visual features from a strong image encoder (e.g., CLIP/Vit-like backbones).
- Project features into the LLM token space via a learned adapter.
- Instruction-tune the combined system on multi-turn image–text data.

Why it works:
- Instruction-tuning induces helpful, harmless, and honest behavior; the visual adapter injects scene information effectively.

## 5) Comparison to Prior Work
- Flamingo: Similar goal but heavier training; LLaVA emphasizes accessible, open instruction-tuning with simpler adapters.
- Task-specific V+L models: LLaVA targets general conversational ability rather than a single benchmark.
- Kosmos-2: Focuses on grounding (e.g., bounding boxes); LLaVA targets dialog quality.

## 6) Results and What They Mean
- Strong qualitative and quantitative results on multimodal chat benchmarks.
- Demonstrates that the LLM alignment recipe extends to multimodal settings with modest components.

Fidelity checks:
- Method: adapter/projection and dataset composition.
- Results: chat benchmarks and VQA-style evaluations.

## 7) Limitations and Failure Modes
- Hallucination and overconfidence persist, especially with ambiguous images.
- Limited spatial precision without explicit grounding supervision.
- Sensitive to dataset quality for instruction-following and safety behavior.

## 8) Fit to This Course (Week 10, Deployment, Agents, and The Future)
- Key Topics & Labs: Multimodal instruction-tuning; adapters; safe chat evaluation for images + text.
- Fit: LLaVA is the open-source counterpart to Flamingo-style systems, enabling students to experiment with multimodal assistants.

## 9) Discussion Questions
1) What instruction datasets best improve harmlessness and helpfulness in a multimodal chat?
2) How would you add retrieval or tool use to LLaVA for grounded reasoning?
3) What minimal adapter architectures preserve performance while reducing compute?
4) How should we measure multimodal hallucination rigorously?
5) How could you add spatial grounding (e.g., pointing) without heavy model changes?

## 10) Glossary
- Visual Adapter: A projection layer mapping image features into the LLM’s token space.
- Instruction Tuning: Supervised fine-tuning on instruction–response pairs to align behavior.
- Multimodal Chat: Dialog grounded in both images and text.
- Hallucination: Generating content not supported by the input image or context.
- Grounding: Linking text to specific regions/objects in images.
