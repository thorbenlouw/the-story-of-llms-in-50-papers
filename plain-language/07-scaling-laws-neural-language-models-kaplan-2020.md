## Before We Had a Map

By 2020, language models could already write surprisingly coherent text, but
building the next breakthrough still felt like guesswork. Teams picked an
architecture, sized the model, scraped some data, and crossed their fingers.
How much should you spend on parameters versus data? Should you train a small
model to perfection or a big one part‑way? Without a guide, every new model was
an expensive roll of the dice.

This paper changed that. It showed that performance follows smooth, predictable
curves as you scale three basics: the number of parameters, the size of the
dataset, and the compute budget used for training. Think of these as three
dimmer switches. If you know how brightness rises when you turn each one, you
can choose the most efficient path to the light you want. Kaplan et al. gave
the field that map.

## The Big Idea: Predictable Scaling

The core insight is that loss (how often the model gets things wrong) follows
clean power‑law relationships with scale. A “power law” means when you plot
performance against size on log–log axes, you get a straight line. In plain
terms: each doubling of scale gives you a steady, predictable improvement—no
magic thresholds, no nasty surprises.

What’s remarkable is how universal this is. Vary model size? Power law. Vary
dataset size? Power law. Vary compute to reach a given loss? Power law again.


Two consequences jump out:

- Bigger models are more sample‑efficient. For the same training budget, a
  larger model needs fewer tokens to hit a target loss. Counter‑intuitively,
  the compute‑optimal strategy is to train very large models on modest amounts
  of data and stop early. In cooking terms, you don’t simmer the stew all
  day—you bring a bigger pot to a controlled boil, then take it off the heat
  early.

- Architectural details matter less than you’d think. Depth versus width, heads
  versus feed‑forward size—if you keep the total non‑embedding parameters
  fixed, performance barely changes. It’s like car‑tuning: swapping tyres helps,
  but engine displacement (total parameters) dominates how fast you can go.

Two key definitions you’ll see again and again in this course:

- Parameters: The learned weights of the model—a cornerstone concept. More
  parameters usually mean more capacity to represent patterns.

- Compute budget: An estimate of the total floating‑point operations during
  training (often written as something like 6 × parameters × batch size ×
  steps). This is essential for planning: it ties your training recipe to the
  practical limits of your hardware.

The paper also offers a unifying view of overfitting: what matters is the ratio
of model size to data. Grow parameters faster than tokens and you risk
memorisation; grow data faster than parameters and you under‑use capacity. The
fits help you pick balanced settings instead of relying on folklore.

## Why It Matters: Engineering at Scale

This wasn’t just a neat curve‑fitting exercise; it re‑wrote the playbook for
building frontier models.

- Compute‑efficient training: For the best performance per unit of compute,
  don’t train to full convergence. Train a much larger model for fewer steps,
  then stop around 10% above the converged loss. That frees budget to build the
  next, bigger model sooner.

- Smarter resource allocation: The laws suggest how model size, batch size, and
  training steps should grow as compute grows. In “road‑trip budgeting” terms,
  they tell you how to split money between petrol (parameters and batch), time
  on the road (steps), and snacks (data) to reach your destination fastest.

- Reliable forecasting: Smooth curves let teams predict performance before
  spending money and make principled trade‑offs.

Crucially, these findings generalise: when models were evaluated on different
distributions (books, Wikipedia, and so on), improvements largely transferred
with a constant offset. Better scaling on WebText2 meant better performance
elsewhere—what you want for general‑purpose models.

This work also set the stage for later refinements. A 2022 study (“Chinchilla”)
argued that optimal data should grow faster than Kaplan estimated. That’s a
friendly amendment rather than a rebuttal: the big picture—predictable gains
from predictable scaling—stood firm.

## Where It Fits in the Story

In this course’s narrative, this paper marks the start of Phase II: once the
Transformer unlocked parallelism and long‑range context, the game shifted to
scaling. “Scaling Laws” provided the blueprint for how to scale responsibly. It
turned heroics into engineering. Teams could pick a compute budget, size the
model with confidence, choose a data target that avoids overfitting, and stop
training at the compute‑optimal point.

That predictability transformed the field. It catalysed massive models (GPT‑3
and beyond), encouraged efficiency innovations (like FlashAttention), and
inspired smarter scaling strategies (such as Mixture‑of‑Experts). The outcome
wasn’t just bigger models—it was a more reliable way to make them better.

Looking ahead, we’ll revisit these trade‑offs—especially the balance between
parameters and data. But the central lesson holds: if you can afford to scale,
performance improves in ways you can plan for.
