## From Hand-Crafted Labels to Broad Reading

For years, progress in language AI meant collecting labelled examples for each
new task—sentiment datasets for reviews, question–answer pairs for QA, and so
on. It was like teaching a student only by past exam papers: effective, but
narrow, expensive, and hard to scale.

GPT‑1 flipped the script. Instead of starting with labels, it started with
reading—vast amounts of ordinary text—then adapted that general knowledge to
specific tasks with a light touch. Think of it as sending a trainee to read a
thousand books before their first day on the job, then giving them a brief
orientation for whatever role you need. That two‑stage recipe—pre‑train on raw
text, then fine‑tune on a small labelled set—became the foundation of modern
NLP.

Two cornerstone concepts recur throughout the course:

- Generative pre‑training: learning to predict the next word in ordinary text.
  By guessing what comes next, the model internalises grammar, meaning, and
  patterns of reasoning without labels.
- Transfer learning: adapting the same model to new tasks with modest labelled
  data—key to today’s “foundation models”.

## The Big Idea: One Decoder, Many Skills

Under the hood, GPT‑1 is a Transformer decoder trained with causal (left‑to‑
right) language modelling. No encoder, no complex task‑specific heads—just one
architecture that learns to continue text and carries that skill into new
settings.

Why does next‑word prediction help elsewhere? To carry on a sentence sensibly,
the model internalises syntax, meaning, and cues for commonsense. It’s like
learning countless short musical phrases; over time you pick up rhythm and
chord progressions that transfer when you improvise.

For specific tasks, GPT‑1 doesn’t add bespoke modules. It reformats the task as
text—e.g., “Premise … Hypothesis … Is the hypothesis entailed?”—a single
sequence the model reads left‑to‑right. It’s the index‑card trick: rewrite
structured problems into natural language the model already handles.

Two more helpful definitions:

- Causal language modelling: The model reads only what came before and predicts
  the next token. This matters for generation and mirrors how we use the model
  at inference time.
- Embeddings: Turning words or pieces of words into continuous vectors. This is
  a cornerstone mechanism for how models represent meaning.

One practical trick makes all of this work smoothly: subword tokenisation (often
via byte‑pair encoding). Instead of treating every rare word as unknown, the
model breaks text into reusable pieces (like "trans" + "former"). This keeps the
vocabulary manageable while still handling novel words. You’ll see this idea
throughout modern LLMs; it’s the quiet enabler that makes training stable and
transferable.

The punchline: with a single, task‑agnostic decoder and light fine‑tuning,
GPT‑1 delivered strong gains across many benchmarks—no bespoke architectures.

## Why It Mattered: Less Labelling, More Leverage

The impact went beyond leaderboards. GPT‑1 showed you can pour unlabelled text
into a general model, then siphon off capability for many applications with
minimal glue code. That changed the economics of NLP: invest once in
pre‑training, amortise the benefit everywhere.

Practically, the approach brought three advantages:

- Data leverage: Pre‑training on long, contiguous books taught extended
  context—useful for comprehension and reasoning. You get broad knowledge from
  raw text.

- Simplicity: Input transformations convert problems into plain sequences.
  Systems stay uniform and easier to maintain.

- Stability: Keeping the language‑model objective during fine‑tuning acts like
  a regulariser, reducing “forgetting” of general competence.

For practitioners, the net effect was a simpler workflow. Instead of inventing
a new architecture for each benchmark, teams could start from one pre‑trained
checkpoint, apply a consistent input formatting recipe, and fine‑tune. That
meant faster iteration, fewer brittle code paths, and results that improved
steadily as pre‑training got better.

An analogy: pre‑training builds the foundations and frame of a house; fine‑
tuning is finishing the kitchen or adding a home office. You don’t pour a new
foundation for every room—you reuse what you’ve already built.

## Where It Fits in Our Story

In this course’s arc, GPT‑1 sits right after the Transformer. Once attention
made parallel training practical (the Big Bang of Phase I), GPT‑1 showed how to
turn that architecture into a general‑purpose learner. We moved from
one‑task‑at‑a‑time systems to the foundation‑model era: train once, adapt widely.

This set the stage for what follows. GPT‑2 pushed pure pre‑training towards
zero‑shot use. GPT‑3 scaled the recipe and showed few‑shot learning via
in‑context examples. Later, instruction tuning and human feedback shaped these
capabilities into helpful behaviour. All assume the GPT‑1 insight: broad
unsupervised learning transfers.

Contrast this with encoder‑based models like BERT, which look both left and
right and excel at understanding tasks. GPT‑style decoders focus on generation
and next‑word prediction, making them natural writers and capable few‑shot
learners. Together they form two thriving families on the same Transformer core.

Looking ahead, we’ll connect this recipe with Scaling Laws and later with
alignment techniques that teach models to follow instructions safely. The
through‑line is clear: GPT‑1 made general language understanding a first‑class
pre‑training outcome, not a by‑product.
