Hiding a Signature in AI Text: Watermarking LLM Outputs

Paper: A Watermark for Large Language Models (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023)

## Introduction: Can We Tell If AI Wrote This?
As LLMs generate more content, institutions want to detect AI‑authored text—for provenance, moderation, or abuse control. But naive detection fails under paraphrasing. This paper proposes a lightweight watermark that subtly biases token choices so detection is possible later, even after light edits.

## The Big Idea: Biased Sampling with a Secret Key
During generation, partition the vocabulary into “green” and “red” sets using a secret key and context hash. Slightly bias sampling towards the green set. Later, a verifier with the key checks if the text shows the expected green‑token skew.

Analogy 1: It’s like micro‑perforations on banknotes—hard to see, easy to test for with the right tool.

Analogy 2: Think of a secret rhythm in music—most listeners won’t notice, but a trained ear can detect the beat.

Key concept: The watermark minimally impacts quality yet leaves a statistical footprint robust to mild paraphrases.

## The “So What?”: Practical Provenance, With Caveats
Watermarking can help platforms moderate spam or attribution, and help enterprises trace unauthorised use. But it’s not fool‑proof: heavy paraphrasing, translation, or attackers with the key can defeat it. It works best as part of a layered defence alongside behavioural signals and metadata.

## Connecting the Dots: Governance Tools for LLMs
Within our course, watermarking is one of several governance primitives (alongside policy, logging, and audits). It addresses accountability in a world of ubiquitous AI text, complementing security‑focused defences like red teaming.

## Conclusion: A Subtle Signature
Watermarks won’t solve attribution alone, but they’re a useful building block when combined with other signals.
