RetNet: Towards the Best of Three Worlds

Paper: Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models (Sun et al., 2023)

## Introduction: Parallel Train, Cheap Infer, Strong Results
The dream backbone would train in parallel like a Transformer, run cheaply like an RNN, and still perform at state‑of‑the‑art levels. Traditional attention nails parallel training but is costly at inference; recurrent models are cheap at inference but tricky to train in parallel.

RetNet aims to square that circle with “retention” mechanisms that behave like attention during training and like efficient recurrence at inference.

## The Big Idea: Retention for Flexible Computation
RetNet introduces a retention operator that can be executed in fully parallel mode (great for GPUs during training) or in a recurrent, cache‑friendly mode (great for low‑latency inference). The same model, two efficient execution paths.

Analogy 1: Think of a hybrid car that can run on electric in the city (efficient, quiet) and petrol on the motorway (powerful, fast), switching modes automatically.

Analogy 2: It’s like a concert recording available as both multitrack (for studio editing) and a compact stereo mix (for quick playback). Same music, two formats optimised for different needs.

Key concept: Decoupling training and inference execution styles without changing parameters offers practical gains in cost and deployment flexibility.

## The “So What?”: Lower Inference Cost, Competitive Quality
RetNet targets the economics of serving. If you can infer with lightweight recurrence, you reduce KV‑cache growth and memory traffic, enabling cheaper deployments and longer contexts. Results show competitive performance while delivering these systems benefits.

For teams, RetNet is a prime example of architecture shaped by operational constraints, not just benchmark scores.

## Connecting the Dots: Architecture Meets Operations
Alongside Mamba, RetNet is part of the “beyond Transformer” exploration. Where Mamba leans into SSMs, RetNet keeps an attention‑like flavour but optimises for inference. Together, they map out options for long‑context, cost‑sensitive deployments.

## Conclusion: One Model, Two Fast Lanes
RetNet’s dual‑mode design points to a future where training and serving aren’t forced into the same compute pattern. Next, we’ll see Hyena, which reimagines long‑range interactions via fast convolutions.
